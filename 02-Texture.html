<!-- 
If we want to have a texture, we need to put it inside tag asset and we put the image that we want
    to use for the texture and give them IDs.
Normal Map : A normal map in 3D graphics is a texture that simulates surface details by altering the
    lighting of an object without adding actual geometry.
Declare in the src attributes to put asset on objects with an hashtag and no color is needed
Use repeat to have 2 times or more (hori or/and vert) the picture (here = more bricks)
Repetitions on src texture need to be there also for normal texture
Look at a-frame documentation on textures to know others attributes to make a texture more realistic
