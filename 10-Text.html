<!-- 
Remember : for all objects in a-frame, we have to declare the position
Like usual, we can use a-text or a-entity
Text is placed in a fixed wrapped horizontal space. If we want to have an appropriate size,
we need to set what we call wrapCount
"Negate :false" is used to set the specified color as background. Here it will be written in white
on a blue background
To use our own font, go the text a-frame documentation and we can find the web-based MSDF Tool. There,
we need to upload our font, select any characters we want to include and download it. Then, we put it on
our folder and we access to it by using his link (l.23)
We can specified a geometry to be the text box
